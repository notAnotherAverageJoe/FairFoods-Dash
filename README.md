- **Monthly Expense Trend**: A line graph that tracks the trend of selected category expenses over time.
- **Scatter Plot**: Visualize correlations between expenses of different categories across months.
- **Average and Total Expenses**: Displays the average and total expenses for both selected categories and overall data.

## Tech Stack

- **Dash**: A Python framework for building web applications with interactive visualizations.
- **Plotly**: A graphing library to create interactive charts like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.
